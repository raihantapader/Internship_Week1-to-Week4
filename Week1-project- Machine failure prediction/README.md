# Week1_Project_Machine_Failure_prediction_Classification_&_FastAPI_project

'''**Machine Predictive Maintenance Classification:** Built a predictive maintenance classifier to anticipate potential machine failures before they occur. Utilized historical sensor data to pre- process and visualize trends, trained classification models using **Scikit-learn**, and evaluated performance using appropriate metrics. Saved the final model with Joblib for reuse and integrated it with a **FastAPI** backend to enable real-time predictions in deployment environments.'''
